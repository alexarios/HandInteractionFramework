# Hand Interaction Framework
The Hand Interaction Framework (HandIF) team looks to create both the hardware and software solution for a fully immersive hand-interaction experience in VR. This framework will allow the grabbing, manipulation, and use of elements in a virtual environment, paired with haptic gloves to simulate the feeling of touching the environment surrounding the user. **Currently, we are working on the software behind the framework, to create an accurate and realistic hand interaction API that can be implemented in a variety of applications, including training scenarios, simulations, and any other environments where precise hand-tracking is necessary.** In the future, we will work to integrate the hardware as well, creating a complete hand-interaction system with maximum immersion.

## How to Test the Demo Scenes
***If hand tracking isn't enabled on your headset, follow [these instructions](https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/controllers-and-hand-tracking/hand-tracking-quest-2/) before proceeding.***


1. Download the demo APK from **HandIF Demo Scenes.**
2. Download SideQuest and follow the [setup instructions.](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto)
3. Connect your Quest 2 headset to computer via USB C cable.
4. Launch SideQuest, and on the top menu, select **Install APK file from folder on computer.**
5. Select the demo APK and wait until it is installed onto the headset.
