# HandInteractionFramework
# HandInteractionFramework The Hand Interaction Framework (HandIF) team looks to create both the hardware and software solution for a fully immersive hand-interaction experience in VR. This framework will allow the grabbing, manipulation, and use of elements in a virtual environment, paired with haptic gloves to simulate the feeling of touching the environment surrounding the user. Currently, we are working on the software behind the framework, to create an accurate and realistic hand tracking experience that can be expanded for use in a variety of applications, including training scenarios, simulations, and any other environments where precise hand-tracking is necessary. In the future, we will work to integrate the hardware as well, creating a complete hand-interaction system with maximum immersion.
